# Water-Potability

Safe drinking water is essential to health and access to safe drinking water is a basic human right. Safe drinking water is also known as potable water. Potable water represents water that does not occur any signiÔ¨Åcant risk to health. It comes from surface water and ground-water sources. The supply of potable water may not always be sustainable and it may be expensive. Tap water meets drinking water quality standards in developed countries. But there is a shortage of safe drinking water sources in developing and poor countries. There are 3 categories of parameters or features that determine the drinking water quality. They are: physical, chemical, and microbiological.

A dataset for safe drinking water quality is used to train and build a machine learning model which determines the water is potable or not after analysing some features of water. K-nearest Neighbour (KNN), a supervised learning method is used to train the machine learning model because the dataset has a dependent variable or label data. The pre-processing steps are done to clean and prepare the data and make the dataset suitable to use. After implementing the proposed machine learning model, the model is compared with other baseline algorithms. Confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall are calculated to evaluate the model.
